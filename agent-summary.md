- Context: Investigated how to make sidebar URLs typesafe.
- Files reviewed: `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/router.tsx`.
- Observation: App uses TanStack Router with registered types. `Sidebar.tsx` uses plain anchors (`<a href>`), and `data` holds raw string URLs.
- Proposal (not yet applied):
  - Replace anchors with TanStack Router's `Link` component.
  - Type the `data` structure so `url` is `LinkProps['to']` for compiler-checked paths.
  - Optionally support route params later by storing `to` and `params` alongside and using `<Link to={...} params={...}>`.
- Next step pending user confirmation: Implement the minimal change in `Sidebar.tsx` to use `Link` and update the `data` type.

- **COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented typesafe navigation in `Sidebar.tsx`:
  - Added `Link` and `LinkProps` imports from `@tanstack/react-router`
  - Defined `NavLeaf` and `NavGroup` types with `to: LinkProps["to"]`
  - Updated `data` structure to use `to` instead of `url`
  - Replaced all `<a href={item.url}>` with `<Link to={item.to}>`
  - Changed placeholder routes from `"#"` to `"/" as const` for type safety
  - All navigation items now use TanStack Router's typed `Link` component
  - Compiler will now catch invalid route paths at build time

- Task: Prevent page scroll; make rankings table content scroll within viewport.
- Decisions:
  - Use ScrollArea from `@/components/ui/scroll-area` for the rankings table body.
  - Disable global body scroll via `overflow-hidden` while keeping `h-screen`.
  - Use flex layout with `flex-1 min-h-0` to allocate space and allow internal scrolling.
- Edits:
  - `src/routes/__root.tsx`: Changed `<body>` classes to `flex flex-col h-screen overflow-hidden`.
  - `src/routes/admin/rankings/route.tsx`:
    - Imported `ScrollArea`.
    - Made outer grid and left column full-height (`h-full`) and flex column.
    - Updated `Card` to `flex-1 min-h-0 flex flex-col`.
    - Updated `CardContent` to `flex-1 min-h-0 p-0` and wrapped `<Table>` in `<ScrollArea className="h-full w-full">`.
    - Removed fixed `max-h` and overflow classes from `TableBody` so ScrollArea controls scrolling.
- Validation: Ran lints on edited files; no issues found.
